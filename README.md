## ☕ Fun Fact

Grant = Great </br>
Niccolo = Overcomer

Hopefully to manifest the combinations of my names.


When I’m not coding, you can find me enjoying some fun activities:

- 🎳 **Bowling** – Striking a balance between competitive spirit and fun!
- 🎮 **Mobile & PC Games** – From strategy games to fast-paced shooters, I love gaming on my downtime.
- 🏸 **Badminton** – A great way to stay active and challenge friends.
- 🏀 **Basketball** – Whether it’s a pickup game or watching the pros, basketball is always exciting.
- 🏓 **Pickleball** – New to the game but already hooked on this fun, fast-paced sport!

I believe hobbies keep the mind fresh, and every new game or sport I try adds a bit more creativity to my work. 😉
